# Cybersecurity Technical Mentor Portfolio

## Overview
This repository supports my work as a **Cybersecurity Technical Mentor**. It contains carefully curated labs, examples, and guided notes used to help learners understand and apply core cybersecurity concepts through practical, tool-based workflows.

The focus of this repository is not volume, but **clarity, ethics, and real-world relevance**. Each section reflects how I guide learners to think critically, use tools responsibly, and develop job-ready cybersecurity skills.
