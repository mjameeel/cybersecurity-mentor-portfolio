# Network Traffic Analysis & Incident Investigation

## Purpose
This section introduces learners to **network monitoring and traffic analysis** as used in troubleshooting, threat detection, and incident response.

---

## Tools Covered
- Wireshark
- tshark

---

## What Learners Will Practice
- Capturing live and recorded network traffic
- Applying display filters
- Identifying abnormal traffic patterns

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understand normal vs abnormal network behavior
- Recognize indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- Apply traffic analysis to real-world security scenarios

---

## Mentor Notes
Many beginners focus on packet counts rather than behavior. I guide learners to look for **patterns and anomalies**, such as repeated SYN packets or unexpected protocol usage.

---

## Ethical Reminder
Traffic capture should only be conducted on networks you own or have explicit permission to analyze.
