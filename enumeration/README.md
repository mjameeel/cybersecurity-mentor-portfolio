# Enumeration & Attack Surface Mapping

## Purpose
This section focuses on **identifying exposed services, technologies, and entry points** after initial reconnaissance.

---

## Tools Covered
- Nmap
- dirb
- whatweb
- Nikto

---

## What Learners Will Practice
- Port and service enumeration
- Web directory discovery
- Technology fingerprinting

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Differentiate between open ports and actual vulnerabilities
- Understand how misconfigurations expand attack surfaces
- Interpret scanner output critically

---

## Mentor Notes
I emphasize that **tools report possibilities, not conclusions**. Learners are coached to validate findings and recognize false positives rather than treating scanner output as definitive.

---

## Ethical Reminder
Enumeration must be performed responsibly and only within approved environments.
