# Reconnaissance & Information Gathering

## Purpose
This section introduces learners to **foundational reconnaissance techniques** used to understand a target’s public-facing attack surface. The emphasis is on ethical, purpose-driven information gathering.

---

## Tools Covered
- ping
- whois
- nslookup
- Sublist3r
- Recon-ng

---

## What Learners Will Practice
- Identifying publicly available information about domains and hosts
- Understanding passive vs active reconnaissance
- Interpreting reconnaissance data responsibly

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Recognize how reconnaissance informs later security testing stages
- Avoid unnecessary or unethical data collection
- Develop a structured reconnaissance mindset

---

## Mentor Notes
Learners often attempt to gather excessive data without context. I guide learners to focus on **relevance**, explaining how each piece of information influences later decisions in vulnerability assessment.

---

## Ethical Reminder
All reconnaissance activities must be performed only on authorized targets or lab environments.
