# Web Application Security Testing

## Purpose
This section helps learners understand **how web application vulnerabilities occur** and how to identify them using industry-standard tools.

---

## Tools Covered
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP

---

## What Learners Will Practice
- Intercepting HTTP requests and responses
- Mapping application endpoints
- Identifying common web vulnerabilities

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understand client–server interactions
- Recognize insecure input handling
- Apply ethical testing practices

---

## Mentor Notes
I focus on helping learners understand **why vulnerabilities exist**, not just how tools detect them. This builds transferable skills beyond specific tools.

---

## Ethical Reminder
Testing should only be conducted on intentionally vulnerable applications or authorized systems.
